# Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project

This project implements and analyzes multiple algorithms with profiling on **time & memory usage**.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Fibonacci (Recursive and Dynamic Programming)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search

## Features

- Profiling execution time using `time`
- Profiling memory usage using `memory_profiler`
- Visualization with `matplotlib`
- Comparison of observed vs. expected performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy memory_profiler jupyter
  ```
